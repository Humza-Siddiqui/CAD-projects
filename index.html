									<p>In our final semester at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), we were tasked with the development of a sorting system tailored for a small business in Sydney. After careful consideration, our team elected to implement an automated conveyor belt solution.</p>
									<p>Utilizing advanced CAD modeling, our system adeptly categorizes diverse packages based on their respective weights. A precision weight sensor serves as the initial data acquisition point, meticulously recording the weight of each incoming package with utmost accuracy. Leveraging this crucial information, an intricate mechanism promptly triggers the appropriate piston corresponding to the package's weight classification.

										Upon nearing the designated piston, the package seamlessly transitions into its designated storage area, facilitated by meticulous coordination between the sensor data and piston activation. Adding further sophistication to our design, infrared sensors meticulously track the distance between each package and its corresponding piston, ensuring seamless and efficient sorting operations at all times.</p>

									<p>For my final project for my SOLIDWORKS class I was asked to make a fully working 8 stroke internal combustion engine.</p>
									<p>In the initial phase of the project, meticulous attention was devoted to crafting each component essential for the functioning of the engine. This comprehensive array encompassed the design and development of crucial elements such as the connecting rod, crankshaft, pistons, and covers, among others.

										Subsequently, in the assembly phase within SOLIDWORKS, these meticulously crafted components seamlessly converged into a cohesive whole. The assembly process demanded precision and a keen eye for detail to ensure optimal alignment and functionality of each part within the engine.
										
										As the crowning achievement of this endeavor, the accompanying video presents an exploded view of the assembled engine. This visual representation offers a comprehensive insight into the intricate interplay and configuration of the engine's constituent parts, showcasing the culmination of meticulous design, engineering, and assembly processes.</p>
